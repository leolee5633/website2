This is personal page about myself. I've been learning to set up this webpage and it should grow up one day to a wonderful website of my thoughts and ideas.
Hope you love it!

# To do:
- Learn how to create a drop menu that directs people to different sub-webpages.
- Learn how to incorparate github projects into the webpage.

# Other thoughts

So far so good. Keep learning.
